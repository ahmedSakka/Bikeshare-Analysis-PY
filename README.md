# Bikeshare Analysis Project

### Date created
August 9th 2023.

### Description
This project is an interactive analysis written in Python language that allows the user to analyze bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, Washington, and New York city. The program presents insights into various aspects such as, the most popular stations, trip duration, user stats, most common month and day, and more.

### Requirements
- Python v3
- Pandas library
- The data files

### Usage
1. Run the analysis by running the `main.py` script:
2. The program will prompt you to select a city to analyze (**Chicago, New York, Washington**).
3. You will then choose to filter the data by month and day or you can apply no filters at all.
4. The program will then present statistics and insights based on what you chose above, including:
- The most frequent times of travel (month, day, hour)
- The most popular start and end stations
- Trip duration statistics
- User statistics, including user types and gender (if available)
- Raw data display upon request
5. After viewing the analysis you can choose to restart the analysis to choose another city or exit the program. 

### Files used
The project uses these data files:
- `chicago.csv`: Bikeshare data for **Chicago** city.
- `new_york_city.csv`: Bikeshare data for **New York** city.
- `washington.csv`: Bikeshare data for **Washington** city.

### Credits
The data was provided by [Motivate](https://motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.
